<p>The internet, at it’s simplest form is a network of interconnected computers where can be shared.</p>

<p>As an example we can think of the internet’s connectivity like a social circle. Information is regularly exchanged and people can be reached through other people. In a simillar way, computers connected to the internet can also share information and reach out to other computers through the internet.</p>

<p>One of the most important models to describe the interactions between computers on the internet is the client-server model.</p>

<h2 id="client-server">Client-Server</h2>
<p><strong>Client</strong>: In our case the client is the device that you will be using to access a website. Something like a laptop or a phone.</p>

<p>To access a website we’ll need a <strong>web browser</strong>.
Web browsers are software that let us render and interact with web pages. Some popular ones are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Google Chrome</li>
  <li>Firefox</li>
  <li>Microsoft Edge</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Server</strong>: Servers are where websites live. There is the hardware and software side of servers, but what we need to know is both act to serve up the website that we’ve requested.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Add a diagram for client-server model</li>
</ul>

<p>Okay, so if we our websites exist on a remote server somewhere, how do we connect our computers to access it?</p>

<h2 id="ip-address">IP Address</h2>
<p>Just as everyone here probably has a physical address, websites also have an address which helps them to be located. IP (Internet Protocol) Addresses are a unique series of numbers seperated by “.”s which indentifies a device and it’s location.</p>

<p>If you’re curious about a website’s IP Address, we can use tools like the site below to see:
https://www.site24x7.com/tools/find-ip-address-of-web-site.html</p>

<p>However, I’m sure most of us don’t navigate the web using IP addresses, that would be very impressive if you do. Instead of typing in 142.250.217.78 into the browser’s search bar, we would put www.google.com. This is what we call a domain name. Domain names and IP Addresses are connected using <strong>DNS (Domain Name System)</strong>, and this is what allows our web navigation as we know it.</p>
