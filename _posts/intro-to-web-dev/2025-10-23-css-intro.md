## CSS Intro

Welcome to the **Style** part of web development! If HTML is the **skeleton**, CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is the **personality** of your site. It is where you determine the look and feel.

### 1. The Anatomy of a CSS Rule

Every line of CSS is a command that follows the same structure: **Selector, Property, and Value.**

```css
/* This is a CSS Rule */
p { 
  font-weight: bold; 
}
```

| Part of the Rule | What it is | Analogy |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **`p`** | **The Selector** | **The Target.** It says: "Find every single element that matches this tag (`<p>`, `<h1>`, etc.)." |
| **`font-weight`** | **The Property** | **The Feature.** This is what you want to change (the color, the size, the spacing, the font, etc.). |
| **`bold`** | **The Value** | **The Setting.** This is what you want the change to *be* (e.g., `blue`, `20px`, `bold`, etc.). |
| **`;`** | **The Semicolon** | **The Stop Sign.** Always put one at the end of every property-value pair! |

### 2. Styling the Entire Website

If you want to change something for the whole website (like the main font or background color), the best tag to target is the **`body`** tag, because *all* your visible HTML content is inside of it!

#### A. Changing the Font

Your website's default font (usually Times New Roman) is a bit boring. Let's make it modern!

```css
body {
    /* Set the font for everything inside the body tag */
    font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;
}
```

> **💡 Secret Backup List:** The browser is smart! It will try to use the first font (`Arial`). If the user’s computer doesn't have it, it moves to the next one (`Helvetica`), and so on.

#### B. Changing the Background Color

The property is spelled the **American way** (`color` without a 'u'). You can use color names (like `Yellow`, `Red`) or special codes.

```css
body {
    background-color: Yellow;
}
```

### 3. The Power of Classes (Creating Exceptions)

What if you want your main title to be blue, but *only* one paragraph to be bold and red? If you just select `p { ... }`, **all** your paragraphs will be styled!

**CSS Classes** let you create **special rules** for just one or two elements.

#### **Step 1: Create the Rule in CSS**

To create a class, start your selector with a **dot (`.`)**.

```css
/* This is a special rule named 'cool-text' */
.cool-text {
    color: red;
    font-size: 1.2rem; /* makes the text 1.2x bigger than normal */
}
```

#### **Step 2: Apply the Class in HTML**

You "activate" the rule by adding the `class` attribute to the HTML tag you want to style.

```html
<p class="cool-text">Only this paragraph will be bold and red!</p>
<p>This paragraph looks normal.</p> 
```

### 4. The Flow of Style: Cascading

CSS stands for **Cascading** Style Sheets. "Cascading" means the rules fall down the sheet like a waterfall.

**The Golden Rule:** If you write the same rule twice, **the last rule read by the browser is the one that wins!**

```css
h1 {
    color: white; /* This color will be IGNORED */
}

h1 {
    color: blue; /* This color WINS because it is written last */
}
```

> **Editor's Note:** You would never write CSS like this! Always group all the styles for one selector together to keep your code clean.

### 5. The Box Model (Spacing is Everything)

Every single HTML element, from your `<h1>` to your `<img>` is treated by the browser as its own **rectangular box**. Understanding this box is key to controlling layout and spacing.

Think of your element as a **Gift Box**:

| Box Component | What it is | How it works |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **Content** | The text or image itself. | The **Toy** inside the box. |
| **Padding** | Space *inside* the border. | The **Bubble Wrap** around the toy. (Adds room between the text and the edge of its background.) |
| **Border** | The line around the element. | The **Cardboard Box** itself. |
| **Margin** | Space *outside* the border. | The space between *your* box and the next box on the shelf. |

#### Example: Adding Padding

By adding `padding` to your `<h1>`, you are adding "bubble wrap" that pushes the text away from the edge of its own background color.

```css
h1 {
    background-color: lightblue;
    padding: 20px; /* Adds 20 pixels of space on ALL 4 sides (top, right, bottom, left) */
}
```

You can even set padding/margin for just one side (e.g., `padding-top: 50px;`) if you only want to push things down a little!
