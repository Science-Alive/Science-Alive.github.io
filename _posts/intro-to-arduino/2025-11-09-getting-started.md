Before we get started with using the Arduino, it'll do us some good to quickly cover what an Arduino is and what we can do with it.

### Arduino
Arduinos are hobby grade open source boards that are manufactured in Italy. They first started in ___ and they continue to create. 

Open source means that the manufacturing details about the board are open to the public, meaning others are able to create their own boards. 
The boards will be using will be a mix of Arduino and Elgoo, which is another company that produces the same board specs, which means everything you learn in this workshop will apply to any Arduino board in the future.

### Why learn about Arduino

Intro to the world of embedded systems? 
If you've interacted with any piece of hardware with a chip in it, such as appliances to robots. All of these things at the building blocks has a chip that interacts with a physical module. 

Arduinos allow us to learn how these interactions work and can even be used for some sophisticated projects.

* Link to some impressive Arduino projects.

Hopefully now we'll be a bit more excited to learn about this great piece of technology.
