### Circuit Basics
A circuit consts of at least one active electronic component and conductive material, such as wires.

### Electronic Signals
Communication between electronic components are facilitated through electronic signals. 
There are two types:
1. Analog
    - A signal that's bound to a range. In Arduino's that is typically between 0-5V or 0-3.3V.
2. Digital
    - Unlike analog there are only two states in a digital system, high and low.
