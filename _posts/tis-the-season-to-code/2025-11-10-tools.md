## Tools and Resources

In order to create our website, we're going to use some nice tools that are pretty standard and well used in the programming scene.

To build our website we'll be using Microsoft's **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)** to edit our HTML and CSS files.

### Why are we using VS code?
It's available on Windows, Mac, and Linux so it's great if you want to work in different operating systems.

It also comes with a bunch of features that are super useful when you're coding and building a project.

You totally can use Windows docs and Notepad to write code. The problems are that it probably won't be a pleasant experience doing so.

Out of the box, VS Code will do things like:
- Code Completion: Like autocomplete when you text, but with code!
- Syntax Highlighting: Will give different sections of code different colours to help with readability
- Extensions: Has a huge marketplace with every tool you might need for future projects

There are also a bunch of other editors that exist as well, such as:
- Zed
- JetBrains (They have program language specific editors)
- Neovim and Emacs

So give those a look too if curious.
