Welcome to the **structure** part of web development! Think of HTML as the **skeleton** of your website, it holds the content and semantic structure of what you're trying to convey to your reader.

---

## 1. The Core Concept: HTML is the Bones

HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the language we use to tell a web browser (like Chrome, Firefox, or Safari) what everything is.

And HTML does so by using tags.

*   **Is it a main title?** ➡️ Use an **`<h1>`** tag.
*   **Is it a normal paragraph?** ➡️ Use a **`<p>`** tag.
*   **Is it a link to another site?** ➡️ Use an **`<a>`** tag.

#### Key Rule: The Tag Sandwich

Most HTML elements are a "sandwich" with two pieces of bread (the tags) and the content in the middle.

| Opening Tag | Content | Closing Tag |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **`<h1>`** | You're Invited! | **`</h1>`** |

> **Notice the Slash (`/`):** The closing tag always has a forward slash (`/`). This tells the browser: "The section I labeled `h1` is now **finished**."

## 2. Setting Up Your Foundation

When you create a new website, it always starts with the same foundational code.

### The Homepage Name Tag: `index.html`

When you type a website name (like *google.com*), the server automatically looks for a file named **`index.html`**. This is your website's **official landing page** or **homepage**.

### The Magic Starter Code (The Skeleton)

When you type **`!`** or **`html:5`** (and press enter) in VS Code, you get this structure. Don't worry about every line, just focus on the two main parts:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <!-- 🧠 The BRAIN (Hidden Info) -->
    <title>My Cool Event!</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <!-- 🧑 The BODY (Visible Content) -->
    <h1>Welcome to My Site</h1>
  </body>
</html>
```

| Tag Name | What it is   | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **`<head>`** | **The Brain** | Holds all the important **secret** information: the title that shows up in the browser tab, links to CSS files, etc. Nothing in the head is visible on the page. |
| **`<title>`** | **The Tab Name** | This is the name that appears in the little tab at the top of your web browser. |
| **`<body>`** | **The Body** | **Everything you want to see** on your actual website (text, images, links) goes between the `<body>` and `</body>` tags. |

## 3. Your Essential HTML Toolbox

You'll need a few tags to build your first page. Think of these as the main tools in your coding toolbox!

| Tag Name | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **`<h1>` to `<h6>`** | **Headlines & Subtitles** | `<h2>Event Details</h2>` |
| **`<p>`** | **Paragraph** | Used for all the main blocks of text. |
| **`<ul>` / `<li>`** | **Unordered List / List Item** | Creates bullet points. (`<ol>` creates numbered lists). |
| **`<a>`** | **Anchor Tag (Link)** | Makes text clickable! You use the attribute `href` to tell it *where* to go. |
| **`<img>`** | **Image Tag** | Used to place pictures. *It's a special tag that does NOT need a closing tag!* |

### The Challenge: Structuring Your Event Site

Now it's your turn. Let's build a simple website for an **event** (a party, a game release, a concert, or even just a hangout).

### Step 1: Set the Title

Inside your **`<head>`** tags, change the text in your **`<title>`** tag to reflect your event.

### Step 2: Create the Main Title and Description

In the **`<body>`** of your page, use the following tags to set the main topic:

1.  Use an **`<h1>`** tag for the biggest, most important title (the name of your event).
2.  Use a **`<p>`** tag for a short description.

> **💡 The Discovery:** Why do you need **`<p>`** tags? Try typing two lines of text without them and see what the browser does! (Hint: HTML cares about structure, not just blank lines.)

### Step 3: Add Details as a List

You need to tell people the **When** and **Where**. Use a sub-title (**`<h2>`**) and an **Unordered List** (**`<ul>`**) to organize your event details.

**Challenge Goal:** Make a unordered list that includes at least three of these:

*   Location
*   Date and Time
*   Dress Code
*   What to Bring

```html
<!-- Example of what to build -->
<h2>Event Details</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Location: My House</li>
  <li>Date: Saturday, Dec 12</li>
  <li>...your other details here...</li>
</ul>
```

### Step 4: Add a Link (The "A" in WWW)

Use an **`<a>`** tag to create a link for people to "RSVP" (reply) or link to other sites.

*   **`href`**: This is an **attribute** (an extra piece of information) that tells the **`<a>`** tag *where* to link to.
*   **`target="_blank"`**: A handy attribute that tells the browser to open the link in a **new tab**.

```html
<h2>RSVP Now!</h2>
<p>
  <!-- Replace the 'href' link with an actual website you like! -->
  <a href="https://www.google.com" target="_blank">Click Here to RSVP</a>
</p>
```

### Step 5: Add an Image

A website is boring without pictures! The **`<img>`** tag is unique because it's a **self-closing tag** (it doesn't need an **`</img>`**).

*   **`src`**: The **source**, this is the link to the image you want to display.
* The link you want to add to your source can be a url link from a different site or it can be from an image that's in the project folder.
*   **`alt`**: The **SUPER IMPORTANT** alternative text. If the picture can't load, or if a visually-impaired user is visiting your site, this text tells them what the picture was. **Always include `alt` text!**

```html
<!-- This link will display a random cat picture as a placeholder! -->
<img 
  src="https://placekitten.com/200/300" 
  alt="A cute cat placeholder image for the event"
>
``` 

## 6. The Finishing Touch: Favicons

Have you noticed the tiny logo next to the text in your browser tab? That is called a **Favicon** (short for Favorites Icon). It’s like the profile picture for your website.

Since this isn't content that appears *on* the page, but rather information *about* the page, it goes inside the **`<head>`** (The Brain).

**How to add it:**
You use the **`<link>`** tag. Unlike the anchor tag **`<a>`**, the link tag is used to connect your HTML file to external resources (like icons or CSS files).

You can find images for favicons at sites like [this](https://www.flaticon.com/)

```html
<head>
  <title>My Cool Event</title>
  <!-- The relationship (rel) is an icon, the href is the file location -->
  <link rel="icon" href="my-logo.png">
</head>
```

> **Pro Tip:** You can use `.png` or `.ico` files for this. If you don't have a small logo ready, you can use an emoji!
>
> *Code for local Favicon:*
> `<link rel="icon" type="images/x-icon" href="assets/christmas-wreath.png">`

## 7. Leaving Notes: HTML Comments

Sometimes you want to leave a note for yourself (or your instructor) inside the code, but you don't want that text to show up on the actual website. These are called **Comments**.

The browser sees the comment symbols and completely ignores everything inside them.

**The Syntax:**
It starts with a less-than bang dash dash `<!--` and ends with a dash dash greater-than `-->`.

```html
<body>
  <h1>My Event</h1>
  
  <!-- TODO: I need to ask the instructor how to change this color later -->
  <p>Welcome to the party!</p>
  
  <!-- This section below is for the RSVP link -->
  <a href="...">RSVP</a>
</body>
```

| Symbol | Meaning |
| :---: | :--- |
| **`<!--`** | **Start of Comment** (Browser: "I will stop reading now") |
| **`-->`** | **End of Comment** (Browser: "Okay, I'm reading code again") |

---

## 8. Quick Concept: Attributes

You might have noticed a pattern with the **`<a>`**, **`<img>`**, and **`<link>`** tags. They all have extra bits of text inside the opening tag, like **`href="..."`** or **`src="..."`**.

These are called **Attributes**.

*   Attributes provide **additional information** about an element.
*   They always come in pairs: **`Name="Value"`**.
*   They always live in the **Opening Tag**.

| Tag | Attribute | Value | Translation |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :--- |
| **`<a>`** | **`href`** | **`https://google.com`** | "I am a link, and **my destination is Google**." |
| **`<img>`** | **`src`** | **`cat.jpg`** | "I am an image, and **my file source is cat.jpg**." |
| **`<p>`** | **`class`** | **`big-text`** | "I am a paragraph, and **my style name is big-text**." |
