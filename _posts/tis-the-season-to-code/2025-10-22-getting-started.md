## Intro to the Web

The internet, at it's simplest form, is a network of interconnected computers where information can be shared between computers.

The internet can be a lot like a social circle with lots of friends. Some know each other directly, while others are connected through mutual friends. Friends can send message to others through their close friends or get invitations to an event through the social grapevine.

One of the most important models to describe the interactions between computers on the internet is the client-server model.

### Client-Server

**Client**: In our case the client is the device that you will be using to access a website. Something like a laptop or a phone. 

To access a website we'll need a **web browser**.
Web browsers are software that let us render and interact with web pages. Some popular ones are:
- Google Chrome 
- Firefox 
- Microsoft Edge

**Server**: Servers are where websites live. There is the hardware and software side of servers, but what we need to know is both act to serve up the website that we've requested.

Okay, so if we our websites exist on a remote server somewhere, how do we connect our computers to access it?

### IP Address
Just as everyone here probably has a physical address, websites also have an address which helps them to be located. IP (Internet Protocol) Addresses are a unique series of numbers separated by "."s which identifies a device and its location. 

If you're curious about a website's IP Address, we can use tools like the site below to see:

However, I'm sure most of us don't navigate the web using IP addresses, that would be very impressive if you do. Instead of typing in 142.250.217.78 into the browser's search bar, we would put www.google.com. This is what we call a domain name. Domain names and IP Addresses are connected using **DNS (Domain Name System)**, and this is what allows our web navigation as we know it.

A domain name is something can be purchased and there are multiple sites to do so. If you have a website name that you'd like to reserve, you can go to a site like  [https://www.namecheap.com/](namecheap) and see how much that would cost.

### Technologies that run the Web
As complex as the internet has become, beneath it all there are 3 technologies that are the pillars of the digital landscape.
- HTML (HyperText Markup Language)
- CSS (Cascading Styling Sheets)
- Javascript (Not to be confused with Java)

As you continue on your programming journey, you'll come to know programmers love acronyms. 
For the purposes of the workshop, we will only be taking a brief look into HTML and CSS. Perhaps we can cover Javascript another time.
