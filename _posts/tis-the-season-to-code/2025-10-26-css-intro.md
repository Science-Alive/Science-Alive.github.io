Welcome to the **Style** part of web development! If HTML is the **structure**, CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is the **personality** of your site. It is where you determine the look and feel.

## 1. The Anatomy of a CSS Rule

Just as HTML uses tags for structure, CSS uses rules to apply style. Every line of CSS is a command that follows the same structure: **Selector, Property, and Value.**

```css
/* This is a CSS Rule */
p { 
  font-weight: bold; 
}
```

| Part of the Rule | What it is | Analogy |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **`p`** | **The Selector** | **The Target.** It says: "Find every single element that matches this tag (`<p>`, `<h1>`, etc.)." |
| **`font-weight`** | **The Property** | **The Feature.** This is what you want to change (the color, the size, the spacing, the font, etc.). |
| **`bold`** | **The Value** | **The Setting.** This is what you want the change to *be* (e.g., `blue`, `20px`, `bold`, etc.). |
| **`;`** | **The Semicolon** | **The Stop Sign.** Always put one at the end of every property-value pair! |

## 2. Types of Selectors: How to Target

There are two main ways to tell CSS *which* elements you want to style.

### A. The Type Selector (The Broad Approach)
This targets **every single instance** of an HTML tag.
*   **Syntax:** Just the tag name (e.g., `h1`, `p`, `img`).
*   **Use case:** "I want *all* my paragraphs to be size 16px."

```css
/* Every <p> tag on the website will be blue */
p {
  color: blue;
}
```

### B. The Class Selector (The Precise Approach)
This targets **only specific elements** that you have labelled. This allows you to create exceptions (e.g., "I want *most* text black, but *this specific* text red").
*   **Syntax:** Starts with a **dot** (`.`) followed by a name you invent.
*   **Use case:** "I want a special style for my error messages."

**Step 1: Create the Rule (CSS)**
```css
/* The dot tells CSS: "Look for a class named highlight" */
.highlight {
  background-color: yellow;
}
```

**Step 2: Apply the Label (HTML)**
```css
<p class="highlight">This text is highlighted.</p>
<p>This text is normal.</p>
```

## 3. Understanding Colors

Computers are very specific about color. There are three main ways to tell the computer which color you want.

| Type | Example | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Named Colors** | `color: red;` | **The Basic Box.** There are about 140 named colors (e.g., `Blue`, `Tomato`, `PapayaWhip`). Great for testing, but limited for design. |
| **Hex Codes** | `color: #FF5733;` | **The Computer's Language.** A hashtag followed by 6 characters (0-9 and A-F). This is the industry standard because it allows for 16 million specific color combinations. |
| **RGB** | `color: rgb(255, 0, 0);` | **Mixing Light.** Stands for **R**ed, **G**reen, **B**lue. You define how much of each light to mix, from 0 (none) to 255 (full blast). |

> **Pro Tip:** You don't need to memorize Hex codes! In VS Code, if you hover over a color, a color picker will appear. You can also search "Color Picker" on Google.

## 4. Typography: Dressing Up Your Text

Most of the web is text, so how that text looks is crucial. We control this using **Fonts** and **Sizing**.

### A. Serif vs. Sans-Serif
When choosing a font family, you usually choose between two main categories.
![Serif vs Sans-Serif](/assets/images/tech/intro-to-web-dev/serif-vs-sans.png)

| Category | Visual Feature | Vibe | Examples |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Serif** | Has little "feet" or decorative lines at the ends of letters. | Traditional, Formal, Newspaper-like. | Times New Roman, Georgia, Garamond. |
| **Sans-Serif** | "Sans" means *without* in French. These letters have clean, straight edges with no feet. | Modern, Clean, Digital-friendly. | Arial, Helvetica, Verdana. |


```css
/* Example of setting a modern font */
h1 {
  font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
}
```

### B. Font Sizing: `px` vs. `rem`
How big should your text be? While you can use pixels (`px`), modern developers prefer using `rem`.

*   **Pixels (`px`):** The rigid unit. `font-size: 16px` forces the text to be exactly that size. It’s easy to understand, but bad for accessibility (users with visual impairments cannot easily scale it up).
*   **Rems (`rem`):** The flexible unit. `rem` stands for **"Root EM"**. It is a multiplier relative to the browser's default setting (which is usually 16px).

**Think of `rem` as a multiplier:**
*   `1rem` = 1x Normal Size (Usually 16px)
*   `2rem` = 2x Normal Size (Usually 32px)
*   `0.5rem` = Half Size (Usually 8px)

> **Why use `rem`?** If a user sets their browser to "Large Text Mode" because they have poor eyesight, `rem` text will automatically grow larger to help them. `px` text will stay small and unreadable. **Be kind to your users: use `rem`!**

## 5. Styling the Entire Website (The `body` Tag)

If you want to change something for the whole website (like the main font or background color), the best selector to use is **`body`**, because *all* your visible HTML content is inside of it!

```css
body {
    /* Set the font for everything inside the body tag */
    font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;
    
    /* Using a Hex Code for a nice dark blue */
    background-color: #1E475B;
    
    /* Using a Named Color for the text */
    color: white;
}
```

> **💡 Secret Backup List:** For `font-family`, the browser is smart! It tries the first font (`Arial`). If the user’s computer doesn't have it, it moves to the next (`Helvetica`), and so on.

## 6. The Flow of Style: Cascading

CSS stands for **Cascading** Style Sheets. "Cascading" means the rules fall down the sheet like a waterfall.

**The Golden Rule:** If you write the same rule twice, **the last rule read by the browser is the one that wins!**

```css
h1 {
    color: white; /* This color will be IGNORED */
}

h1 {
    color: blue; /* This color WINS because it is written last */
}
```

## 7. The Box Model (Spacing is Everything)

Every single HTML element, from your `<h1>` to your `<img>`, is treated by the browser as its own **rectangular box**. Understanding this box is key to controlling layout.

![Box model diagram](/assets/images/tech/intro-to-web-dev/Box_model.png)

Think of your element as a **Gift Box**:

| Box Component | What it is | How it works |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **Content** | The text or image itself. | The **Toy** inside the box. |
| **Padding** | Space *inside* the border. | The **Bubble Wrap** around the toy. (Adds room between the text and the edge of its background.) |
| **Border** | The line around the element. | The **Cardboard Box** itself. |
| **Margin** | Space *outside* the border. | The space between *your* box and the next box on the shelf. |

#### Example: Adding Padding

By adding `padding` to your `<h1>`, you are adding "bubble wrap" that pushes the text away from the edge of its own background color.

```css
h1 {
    background-color: lightblue;
    padding: 20px; /* Adds 20 pixels of space on ALL 4 sides */
}
```
