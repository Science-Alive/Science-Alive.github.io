## Intro to Computer Organization

When we operate and look at computing devices, it's easy get lost in all their complexity, however the starting blocks of all software are folders (or directories) and files. 

A **file** is a collection of information and they're organized by specific file types. Different file types will hold specific and different information such as a written message, an image, a video, and even programs. Perhaps you can think of this as notes, homework, papers, and other documents you probably do for school.

A **folder** is how files are given further organization. Folders can store files, but also other folders to group together similar files. In a computer system this might be placing all of your photos in one specific folder, but even that can cluttered so maybe you want to group together all the vacation photos into a seperate folder. You can think of this like organizing your school work by different subjects, like math and english, and if you're really organized, seperating by different topics within the subject.

All computing devices will have files and folders. The file navigation will be slightly different depending on the operating system of the the computer.

In the above image you can see a folder that contains 2 different types of files as well as another folder.

The 3 main common operating systems for computer systems are:
- Microsoft Windows
- macOS
- Linux 

When working with computers you will most likely run into these 3 computers, so it's good be familiar with their inner workings.
In the workshops we will be working on either Windows or macOS as they are the most common operating systems.

### Windows File Explorer

Windows uses File Explorer as their default file navigator. Usually it's pinned in the task bar at the bottom of the screen and when you open it, you should see an application like the diagram below.

### macOS File Navigation

Mac uses the Finder, which is not only a file navigator but also launches other applications. You should be able to find Finder in the dock at the bottom of the screen.

### File Paths 
A file path is a way to specify the location of folders and files. 

A file path for macOS or Linux might look like this:
**/home/username/Wattson/hello.txt**

In the above example we can see that folders are seperated using the **forward slash ( / )** and the file names end with their type, in this case a text file.

With Windows the file path looks a little different, the same example above might look like this:
**C:\Users\Wattson\hello.txt**

The biggest differences being that Windows use a letter based drive as well as using the **backward slash ( \\ )** to seperate folder names.

### Practice
