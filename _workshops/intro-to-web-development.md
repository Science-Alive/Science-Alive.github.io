**Stop just using the internet: start building it!**

In this beginner-friendly workshop, you'll go behind the scenes of the World Wide Web to learn how websites actually work. We'll explore the digital landscape's infrastructure, then dive straight into the two core technologies of the web: HTML and CSS. By the end, you'll be creating and styling your very own personalized website that you can proudly share with friends and family!
