In this beginner-friendly workshop, you'll go behind the scenes of the World Wide Web to learn how websites actually work. We'll explore the two core technologies of the web: HTML and CSS. By the end, you'll be creating and styling your very own personalized Pal-entine's website that you can proudly share with friends and family!
